# RustExercises ðŸ¦€ðŸ“š

Welcome to **RustExercises** â€” a collection of small projects and exercises I've completed while learning the Rust programming language.

This repository is meant to document my journey through different aspects of Rust, including:

-Methods and traits

Each folder in this repo typically contains a standalone Cargo project focused on a specific concept or pattern.

## ðŸ›  Structure
RustExercises/
- binary_tree/ # Using binary tree to practice using smart pointers
- builder_type/ # Using builder pattern for practicing memory management
- generic_counter/ # Using generics for a simple counter
- generic_min/ # Using generics for functions, traits, parameters, and trait bounds
- log_filter/ # Using closures and traits for filtering logs
- logger_trait/ # Using traits for flexible logging
- rot13_cipher/ # Using standard library traits to implement a ROT13 cipher
- ...

Each subfolder contains:
- A `Cargo.toml` file
- A `src/` directory with Rust source code

## ðŸš€ How to Run an Exercise

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kdodson/RustExercises.git
   cd RustExercises
2. Navigate to the exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd trait_logger
   cargo run

## ðŸ§ª Notes
- These projects are not polished applications. They're meant to be educational and exploratory.
- Many were built while following Rust books, tutorials, and documentation.
